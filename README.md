# AuraSolutions.MediaAutomation
This repository contains a C# console application designed to automate the process of creating media content for a YouTube channel. The application interacts with various AI APIs (like Hugging Face) to generate assets such as music, voiceovers, and videos, and then uses a powerful tool like FFmpeg to assemble them into a final video file.
